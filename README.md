# donationwebapplication-bandits

A web application is to be built to bring all the NGOs available in Pakistan to a 
single online platform where donors could easily skim through these non-profits, 
lookout for the desired campaigns being run by these NGOs and could facilitate 
with the option of online donations. Whereas on the NGOs' side, easy management 
of campaigns and donations would ease the overseeing of operations.
